This repository is an experement in generative art, mostly inspired by [r/generative](redit.com/r/generative). My goal was to create a new, small piece of computer-generated art every day.


Go to [https://quinnfreedman.github.io/doodles/](https://quinnfreedman.github.io/doodles/) to check it out. Add `?n=one` or another number to the URL to see a specific piece, or `seed=1234` to set the random seed. Or, use the arrow keys to navigate and click on the canvas to re-generate.
